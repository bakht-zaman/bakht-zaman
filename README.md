- 👋 Hi, I’m Bakht Zaman, PhD in Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I am currently available on the job market.
- I postdoctoral fellowship experiences in various European research and innovation projects. I am interested in using
statistical modeling to address problems in industrial applications, employing methods from statistical
analysis, time series, convex optimization, signal processing, and machine learning (e.g. deep learning) and other AI techniques. I aim to develop,
implement, test and deploy cutting-edge solutions based on statistical learning, optimization, signal
processing, and machine learning to tackle data analytics related problems within industrial applications.
Moreover, I am also interested in developing efficient (in terms of memory and computation), intelligent
(machine/statistical learning-based), and explainable (using explainable AI–XAI) solutions for real-time
streaming data scenarios in business applications.
- 👀 Mainly, I’m interested in Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Convex Optimization, Data Analytics, and Time Series Analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring cloud computing, NLP, LLMs, SQL, CI/CD, MLOPs, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on inference for multidimensional time series, Online machine-learning algorithms for streaming data, and Statistical Signal Processing (Estimation and Detection Theory)
- 📫 How to reach me. You can contact me at engr.bakhtzaman@gmail.com
